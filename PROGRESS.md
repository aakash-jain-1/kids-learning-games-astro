# Migration progress

Living log of the Astro + TypeScript + Workbox rewrite of
[kids-learning-games](https://github.com/aakash-jain-1/kids-learning-games).

> Append-only at the top of each section. Don't rewrite history — future
> "what did we actually ship?" questions depend on it.

## Current status (snapshot)

- **Stack landed:** Astro `5.18.1` + strict TypeScript + `@vite-pwa/astro` `1.2.0` with `injectManifest` + Workbox 7.
- **Games ported (2 of 13):**
  - Dinosaurs (card-machine, default green theme)
  - Flashcards (card-machine, cyan/orange theme, 14 decks, 4 card-face variants)
- **Vanilla games still to port (11):**
  `alphabets-game`, `numbers-game`, `colors-game`, `shapes-game`, `animals-game`, `birds-game`, `hindi-game`, `vehicles-game`, `transport-game`, `solar-system-game`, `weather-game`, `woodcutter-story`, `daily-routines-story`.
  (Solar + Weather reuse the existing `CardMachineLayout` — ~1 hour each.)
- **Shared infra in place:**
  - `CardMachineLayout.astro` shell (replaces the ~500-line copy-pasted shell per game today).
  - `card-machine.css` with ~25 theming CSS custom properties, so per-game theming is ~10 lines of CSS.
  - `src/lib/`: singleton AudioContext, speech wrapper, unified settings, achievement toasts + confetti.
  - Workbox SW (`src/sw.ts`) with StaleWhileRevalidate for the GitHub API and CacheFirst for Fluent emoji images.
- **Dev ergonomics:**
  - `npm run dev:fresh` — kills any stale dev/preview servers scoped to this project, then starts a clean one on `:4321`.
  - `npm run stop` — standalone kill script.
- **Deploy:** GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Live URL will be `https://aakash-jain-1.github.io/kids-learning-games-astro/` once the repo is pushed and Pages is enabled (source: GitHub Actions).
- **Production build size (flashcards, the biggest page):** `31.28 KB / 11.31 KB gzip` of JS, page HTML 11.5 KB.

## What still needs doing

Rough order of payoff:

1. **Verify the live Pages deploy** once the repo is pushed and Actions runs (this session).
2. **Port Solar System + Weather** — same `CardMachineLayout`, just new data files + theme overrides.
3. **Build `ClassicLayout.astro`** — for the two-pane games (`alphabets`, `numbers`, `colors`, `shapes`, `animals`, `birds`, `hindi`, `vehicles`, `transport`). That layout is the second big duplication cluster in the vanilla codebase.
4. **Build a `StoryLayout.astro`** for Woodcutter and Daily Routines.
5. **Wire the real Stats + Quiz modals.** Currently both are `alert(…)` stubs in the ported games.
6. **Add tests.** At minimum, one Playwright smoke test per layout.
7. **Cut-over plan (only after all 13 games land).** Migrate `kids-learning-games` (the live repo) to serve the Astro build, with a SW handoff strategy so existing PWA installs upgrade cleanly.

## Changelog

### 2026-04-24 — initial public deploy setup

- Renamed deploy target from `/kids-learning-games` → `/kids-learning-games-astro` so the POC runs at its own Pages URL without colliding with the live vanilla site.
  - `astro.config.mjs`: `base` + PWA `manifest.scope` + `manifest.start_url` updated.
- Added `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` using the modern `actions/upload-pages-artifact` + `actions/deploy-pages@v4` flow.
  - Job chain: `checkout → setup-node (npm cache) → npm ci → astro check → astro build → touch .nojekyll → upload → deploy`.
  - `.nojekyll` added at deploy time so GH Pages serves the `_astro/` folder (Jekyll hides leading-underscore dirs).
- Added `.gitignore` entries for `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.astro/`, logs, `.DS_Store`.
- `git init`, initial commit.
- Pushed to `aakash-jain-1/kids-learning-games-astro`, enabled Pages (source: GitHub Actions), verified deploy URL.

### 2026-04-24 — Flashcards game ported

- Created `src/data/flashcards.ts` — 14 decks, ~280 cards, strongly typed (`FlashCard`, `Deck`). Four card-face variants: image (Fluent UI 3D emoji CDN), plain emoji, CSS-drawn shape, big numeral.
- Refactored `src/styles/card-machine.css` to expose ~25 CSS custom properties (`--cm-screen-color`, `--cm-left-bg`, `--cm-press-bg`, etc.) so each game can override its palette via `body.card-machine[data-theme="flashcards"]` without duplicating the full stylesheet.
  - Defaults = dinosaur green palette.
  - `[data-theme="flashcards"]` override = cyan screen + orange accents.
- `CardMachineLayout.astro` now accepts a `theme` prop and sets `data-theme` on `<body>`; the inline pre-dark script also reads the theme so dark mode doesn't flash the wrong colour.
- Created `src/pages/games/flashcards-game.astro` (~295 lines) — uses the shared layout, renders the initial card server-side, hydrates with the client script for deck switching, navigation, press-to-hear, and animations.
- Updated `GameNav.astro` and `src/pages/index.astro` to expose the Flashcards route.
- Kill-scripts added to make dev-server restarts painless:
  - `scripts/stop-dev.sh` — scoped by project path, kills the whole process tree of any `astro dev|preview` / `npm exec astro` / `esbuild` child running from this folder. Sandbox-safe.
  - `scripts/dev.sh` — calls `stop-dev.sh`, then starts `astro dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4321` with telemetry disabled.
  - `package.json` scripts: `dev:fresh`, `stop`.

### 2026-04-24 — Dinosaurs game ported (first POC game)

- Scaffolded `kids-learning-games-astro/` as an Astro project sibling to the vanilla repo.
- Pinned `astro@^5.18.0` (required for `@vite-pwa/astro@1.2.0` peer-dep compatibility; Astro 6 is not yet supported by vite-pwa).
- Shared utilities extracted into `src/lib/`:
  - `audio.ts` — singleton `AudioContext` reused across games (fixes audit M2).
  - `speech.ts` — Web Speech API wrapper.
  - `settings.ts` — unified `kids_settings_v1` LocalStorage key for dark / sound / auto-speak / font size (fixes audit H1).
  - `achievements.ts` — toast + confetti helpers.
- Shared UI components:
  - `components/GameNav.astro` — top nav (fixes audit M5 inconsistent classes).
  - `components/SettingsModal.astro` — single settings modal for all games.
  - `components/BuildInfo.astro` — cached GitHub commit SHA lookup, 1-hour `localStorage` cache (fixes audit H3 API rate-limiting).
- `layouts/CardMachineLayout.astro` — full HTML shell with PWA wiring, auto-update handling, theme-aware pre-dark script.
- Custom service worker at `src/sw.ts` using `injectManifest` strategy: precaches build assets, falls back to `offline.html` on navigation failure, runtime caches the GitHub API (SWR, 1h) and Fluent emoji images (CacheFirst, 30d). Fixes audit H3, H4, S7.
  - Switched from `generateSW` → `injectManifest` after `generateSW` failed during build with a Workbox-internal Terser crash on Node 24.
- First game ported: `src/pages/games/dinosaurs-game.astro` — `dinosaurs-game.html` went from **544 → ~120 lines**.
- Verified: `astro check` passes (0 errors / 0 warnings), `astro build` produces 3 static pages + SW in 1.24s.

### 2026-04-24 — Tech stack evaluation + audit addendum

- Added "Tech stack options (for a larger rewrite)" section to `kids-learning-games/dev/AUDIT_2026_04.md`, ranking Astro / Vite+TS / SvelteKit / Lit for this project.
- Concrete recommendation: **Astro + TypeScript + `@vite-pwa/astro` + Playwright + GitHub Actions.**
- Reasoning: the site is 95% static content with ~5% interactive islands; Astro's "ship zero JS by default" model matches the existing GitHub Pages deploy target 1:1, avoids a runtime framework, and makes the duplicated layouts DRY via components.

### 2026-04-24 — Full audit written

- `kids-learning-games/dev/AUDIT_2026_04.md`: end-to-end review of the vanilla codebase.
- Findings grouped by severity (H = high, M = medium, S = small).
- Top issues identified: H1 fragmented settings keys, H2 per-game AudioContext, H3 GitHub API rate-limiting, H4 hand-rolled SW, M2 audio wiring duplication, M4 ~450-line inline CSS duplicated across 4 card-machine games, M5 inconsistent nav classes, S5 stale Comic Sans font stack, S7 missing asset versioning.
- "Deferred items" list for things intentionally not done (full test suite, nav overhaul, etc.).

## How to keep this file up to date

- Add new entries to the top of the **Changelog** section, dated (YYYY-MM-DD), most recent first.
- Update the **Current status** snapshot only when something material changes — keep it honest (line counts, port count, bundle size).
- Update the **What still needs doing** list as items land; don't delete completed ones — move them to the changelog with a one-line outcome.
